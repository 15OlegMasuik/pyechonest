We're moving pyechonest from SVN to git, and hosting it on Github.
The old Google Code repository will be deprecated but otherwise 
left alone for the short term, and we'll delete it eventually. 
All history was maintained in the move.

How to do a release:

# first update the documentation submodule
# this will update the gh-pages (pyechonest documentation) available at:
# http://echonest.github.com/pyechonest/

$ cd doc
$ make html
$ cd build/html
$ git commit -a -m 'made some changes, yo'
$ git push

# then commit the rest of your changes from the root of the repo

$ cd ../
$ git commit -a -m 'made some changes, yo'
$ git push

# make a tag
$ git tag -a 4.2.16 -m "4.2.16 tag with feature A feature B etc"
$ git push --tags

# create the zip and egg files
$ ./mkrelease ~/
# upload them to github
